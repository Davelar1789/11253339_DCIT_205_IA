        <h1>Welcome to the Computer Science Department</h1>
        <p>We find ourselves in the era of Information Technology, where the essence of Computer Science is pivotal. Embracing the study of computer science becomes imperative for society to fully harness the advantages offered by Information Technology, leading to rapid economic advancements. Computer science encompasses the exploration and creation of applications that facilitate our daily interaction with computers, the underlying software systems supporting these applications, and the methodologies employed to develop applications and systems that demonstrate reliability, correctness, and ethical behavior.At the core of Computer Science lies the art of computer programming. Employers seeking Computer Scientists anticipate proficient programmers equipped with knowledge of contemporary techniques and tools. They look for individuals capable of applying sound engineering principles in the development, construction, and maintenance of computer programs.

Our department offers a diverse range of courses, fostering skills that empower students to secure employment across various sectors of the economy. Graduates are well-prepared for careers in the computing industry, contributing to project teams or research and development teams. Our programs equip graduates to bring specialized skills to their teams, creating a pathway for further studies or research. Exposure to established and emerging technologies, along with engagement in active fields of research in Computer Science, enriches the learning experience.

The Department provides two undergraduate degree programs: the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with options for a Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1), as well as the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.

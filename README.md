*Introduction And Purpose of My Website*

Welcome to my version of the University of Ghana computer Science department website. Mainly a task and project assigned by the department, it also serves as an eye-opening experience. The website aims at displaying the computer science department to the world, so that others will be able to love and cherish the department. It provides information on the department and answers very important questions likely to be raised by others not in the department. Prospective students can also use this as a guide in registering into one of the best departments in the school.

*Detailed introductions on how to clone and set up the project*
Before cloning, you must ensure that you have git and VS Code fully installed and running on your machine.
Now follow these steps to clone:
1. On your github repository, copy the https 
2. In your VS code terminal, enter the following command

*Lessons I have Learnt From the Project*

Throughout this project, I have gained valuable insights into web designing. Some notable takeaways include:

1. I got improved proficiency in HTML and CSS.
2. I enhanced my understanding of tags, syling and responsiveness.
3. I overcame challenges such as adjusting sizes to fit space, creating buttons and mainly about the responsiveness.

I have learnt in summary that although difficult, web designing is a very interesting and productive part of computer science.

*Conclusion*

A rich experience indeed.
